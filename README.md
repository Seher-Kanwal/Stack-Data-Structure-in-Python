# Stack-Data-Structure-in-Python
Stack Data Structure in Python with different exercise 

# STACK:
  In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main operations:

   *  Push, which adds an element to the collection, and
   * Pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.
   
   
### Here is another operation that helps to view the top element without removing it from stack:   
   * Peek operation can, without modifying the stack, return the value of the last element added. 

# Order:
The order in which an element added to or removed from a stack is described as last in, first out, referred to by the acronym LIFO.


# we have different ways of implementing the stack in python:
### * Using list
      Stack concept are done by using arrays and linked lists where the top position is tracked using a variable or header pointer respectively
      The method that will be used:

      * append(x): Appends x at the end of the list
      * pop() : Removes last elements of the list
      
### * Using Deque from Collection library
### * Using Class that also include Deque

# Applications of Python Stack
     Stacks are considered as the backbone of Data Structures. Most of the algorithms and applications are implemented using stacks.

#### Some of the key applications of Python Stacks are—

* Used in browsers to move to the last page we visited
* used in “undo” mechanism in the text editor.
* Language processing:
* space for parameters and local variables is created internally using a stack.
* compiler’s syntax check for matching braces is implemented by using stack.
* support for recursion.
* Expression evaluation like postfix or prefix in compilers.
* Backtracking (game playing, finding paths, exhaustive searching.
* Python Stack is also used in Memory management, run-time environment for nested language features. etc
* Used in Algorithms like Tower of Hanoi, tree traversals, histogram problem and also in graph algorithms like Topological Sorting.
